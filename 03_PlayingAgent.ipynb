    "The OpenAI Gym (https://gym.openai.com) provides us with a lot of different examples and games in which to train a learning agent. The task is to develop one of such agents. We will create a neural network that, given the state of the game (actually, two consecutive states), it outputs a family of quality values (Q-values) for each next possible move. The move with higher Q-value is chosen and performed in the game. This theoretical formalism was taken from https://www.nervanasys.com/demystifying-deep-reinforcement-learning/"
